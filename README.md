This repo showcases an end-to-end Arabic Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) workflow using Wav2Vec 2.0 and Mozilla Common Voice. It includes a cleaned Jupyter notebook for data loading, 16 kHz resampling, quick inference, and optional WER evaluation with jiwer. Designed as a learning/portfolio piece and a solid starting point for fine-tuning.
